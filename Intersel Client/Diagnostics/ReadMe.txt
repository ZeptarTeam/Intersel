xSolon.Tracing - Source Project
===============================
This project provides basic tracing functionality based on the .net System.Diagnostics namespace.

This nuget package adds ssource code so that you can modify it to suit your needs without dll dependencies.

When upgrading the package from nuget files that already exist in your project will not be updated.
If you want to get the latest version, please rename/delete/move existing files so that the new version can 
be downloaded.

Some of the code (ActivityScope & LogicalOperationScope) are based on the great Essential.Diagnostics 
(http://essentialdiagnostics.codeplex.com/) project under the Microsoft Reciprocal License (Ms-RL).
